Throughout my academic career, I have been honored with several scholarships and awards, including **the National Scholarship** from the Ministry of Education of China, and the **Merit Student** award from the Ministry of Education of Heilongjiang Province. I am also a student member of **the Architectural Society of China** （[中国建筑学会](https://www.chinaasc.org.cn/)） and **the ACM China Council SIGSPATIAL Chapter**.

In my spare time, I enjoy creating digital artworks and leveraging my design skills in urban planning projects. I also relish outdoor activities such as hiking and urban exploration, which not only allow me to appreciate the beauty of natural and built environments but also provide inspiration for my urban planning projects.
