Welcome to my personal webpage!ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

I am **Zeyun DENGï¼ˆé‚“æ³½æ˜€ï¼‰**, a passionate undergraduate student in the field of **Urban and Rural Planning**. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at the [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)ï¼ˆ[å“ˆå°”æ»¨å·¥ä¸šå¤§å­¦](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)ï¼‰, with an expected graduation in July 2024. During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of being an exchange student at the [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen Campus](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/) ï¼ˆ[å“ˆå°”æ»¨å·¥ä¸šå¤§å­¦ï¼ˆæ·±åœ³ï¼‰](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html)ï¼‰in China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ and the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª.

My research interests in urban planning primarily encompass **spatial-temporal data visualization**, **urban history**, and **emerging technologies in urban and rural planning**. I am proficient in Python and R for spatial analysis and data visualization, and have a solid command of **GIS-related toolkits and packages** such as ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, and CityEngine, as well as **planning and design software** such as Rhino, AutoCAD, and the Adobe Suite. Moreover, I possess extensive field experience, including survey design and implementation, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, geo-database management and mapping, and natural language processing.

Throughout my academic career, I have been honored with several scholarships and awards, including **the National Scholarship** from the Ministry of Education of China, and the **Merit Student** award from the Ministry of Education of Heilongjiang Province. I am also a student member of **the Architectural Society of China** ï¼ˆ[ä¸­å›½å»ºç­‘å­¦ä¼š](https://www.chinaasc.org.cn/)ï¼‰ and **the ACM China Council SIGSPATIAL Chapter**.

In my spare time, I enjoy creating digital artworks and leveraging my design skills in urban planning projects. I also relish outdoor activities such as hiking and urban exploration, which not only allow me to appreciate the beauty of natural and built environments but also provide inspiration for my urban planning projects.

> I look forward to sharing my research findings and innovative ideas with you. Should you have any questions or suggestions about my work, please feel free to contact me.
