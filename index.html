Hello! I'm Zeyun Deng, an enthusiastic undergraduate in Urban and Rural Planning at Harbin Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate in July 2024. I've had the honor of studying at the Shenzhen campus of Harbin Institute and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. My research interests are spatial-temporal data visualization, urban history, and new technologies in urban planning. I'm a member of the Architectural Society of China and the ACM China Council SIGSPATIAL Chapter. In my free time, I enjoy digital art, outdoor activities, and urban exploration. I'm always excited to share my research and innovative ideas, so feel free to reach out!
