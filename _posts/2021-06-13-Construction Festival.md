Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920, during a time when the field of civil engineering was heavily influenced by the dominant forces of Russia. The architectural design of this establishment drew inspiration from the iconic work of Russian Constructivism in the same year, known as the "Monument to the Third International." Embracing the spirit of innovation, it employed two intertwined and nested circular forms as its architectural elements, with structural designs reminiscent of sturdy steel trusses, reminiscent of the charm found in the Harbin Binjiang Railway Bridge. As the construction ascends from the ground, it gradually transcends the realm of solidity and embraces ethereal qualities. Under the caress of sunlight, a tapestry of mottled light and shadow dances enchantingly, creating an ethereal allure known as "Ethereal Shadows."

哈尔滨工业大学建校于 1920 年，彼时的土木建筑科创始之初受到俄国强势影响。本建构以同年的俄国构成主义作品《第三国际纪念碑》为灵感，使用两个互相交错嵌套的圆形作为形体构成，结构设计模仿钢铁三角桁架，有哈尔滨滨江铁路桥之韵味。建构从下而上脱实向虚，形体逐渐消隐，在阳光照耀下，斑驳光影梦幻悬浮，是为“玄影·悬隐”。
