Cities worldwide face growing threats from climate change, socioeconomic shifts, and political instability. Yet, their resilience plans remain fragmented across formats, languages, and regions—making it nearly impossible to compare strategies or adopt proven solutions.

**Introducing the Resilient City Knowledge Graph (RCKG)**

Our AI-driven platform transforms this chaos into clarity. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and a dynamic knowledge graph, RCKG automates the analysis of multi-modal urban resilience data—from policy documents to environmental reports. It uncovers hidden patterns, identifies global-local synergies, and recommends actionable strategies tailored to each city’s unique challenges.  

**Why It Matters**

- **96% Faster Policy Analysis**: Extracted 1,635 heat adaptation policies from 370,000+ characters of urban planning texts, slashing manual review time by 96%.  
- **Global Insights, Local Action**: Revealed how Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam align green infrastructure goals, enabling cross-city learning.  
- **Science-Backed**: Presented at ACSP 2024 and under review in *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems* (IF=6.8).  

**Join the Resilience Revolution**
