This project commenced in July 2016, during a period of ennui in my home, as I was about to embark on my high school journey. I embarked on an exploration, employing the Minecraft game as a means to reconstruct real campus settings, employing Guangdong Beijiang Experimental School（广东北江实验学校） as a representative example. Through numerous alterations to the Minecraft archive, this project finally saw the light of day after my completion of university studies and mastery of rendering software. If you find yourself captivated by this reconstructed campus environment, please do not hesitate to contact me!
